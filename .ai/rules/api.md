# Public API and MCP

## Scope: the API answers own rows, MCP stays space-wide
`/api/v1` answers the caller's own rows, in a shared space too, and ids in a body are checked as the caller's. MCP tools stay space-wide on purpose: never port upstream's own-rows narrowing onto them, and never widen the API to match them. A figure shared by both surfaces belongs in a presenter or service; a difference between them belongs in the API's resource or form request, so MCP and the web keep their output.

## Income-rate savings goals are withheld in a shared space
An income-rate goal is measured against its whole space's income, so its target reveals a co-member's income even with `income_base` blanked. `SavingsGoalIncomeWithholding` nulls every figure derived from it on the API and refuses creating one there. It checks current membership only: whoever adds leaving a space or moving a goal must also treat periods frozen while the space was shared, or the figures come back.

## Encrypted fields read as an empty string
An account name or a note still encrypted on the device reads `''` on the API, never ciphertext. A client writing back the `''` it read must not erase the value, so a blank `notes` on an encrypted note is a 422. Never derive a stored value from an encrypted field: an auto-tag rule built from an encrypted account name stores ciphertext and can never match.

## A filtered split is one whole row
A list filtered by category or label returns the split parent once, with its `amount` and every line in `splits`, those outside the filter too, so lines still add up to the parent. A client totalling a category reads the lines. This differs from the day totals and filter summaries, which add only the matching lines.

## OAuth metadata: route:cache and scopes
Production runs `route:cache`, which restores the package's closures on the package class, so overriding `protectedResourceMetadata()` answers `mcp:use` there. Metadata and route changes go in `OAuthRegistrar` as explicit routes, and need a real `route:cache` probe. Authorization server metadata lists `mcp:use` alone: a client requesting everything listed there would ask for both surfaces and get `invalid_scope`. `api:use` is advertised on the `/api/v1` resource metadata only.
