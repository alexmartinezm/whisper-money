     * subtree, a category and `label_ids` sent together match either, and each
     * other filter narrows further.
     *
     * A split transaction is one row. A filter that matches one line returns
     * the whole transaction: `amount` stays the full amount and `splits` holds
     * every line, the ones outside the filter included, so to add up a category
     * read its lines, not `amount`. Labels sit on the transaction, not on a
     * line, so `label_ids` matches every line of it.
     *
     * `query` reads what the server can read: an encrypted description or note
     * never matches, though the row can still match on the counterparty names
     * or any other filter, and reads as `''` in those fields.
     *
     * A parameter this list does not take is a `422`, so a misspelt filter
     * never answers with every transaction.
