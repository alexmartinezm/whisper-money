/**
 * The filters of `GET /api/v1/transactions`, on top of the transactions list's
 * own {@see Transaction::scopeApplyFilters()}, so the API and the app agree on
 * what a filter matches. A category picks its whole subtree and matches a
 * split transaction through any of its lines; a category and labels sent
 * together are one filter, matching either. A split transaction stays one row.
 *
 * Two filters stay out of applyFilters on purpose. It reads amounts in major
 * units and multiplies them in floating point, which would miss exact minor
 * units (19.99 * 100 is 1998.9999999999998). And its search runs LIKE over the
 * stored text, which on a row encrypted on the device is ciphertext: a match
 * there would be noise, so `query` only reads text the server can read.
