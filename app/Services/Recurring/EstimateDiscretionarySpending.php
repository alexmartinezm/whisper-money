/**
 * How much leaves the account every month that detection knows nothing about.
 *
 * The recurring projection walks subscriptions and bills, which for most people
 * is well under half of what they spend. Groceries, restaurants, fuel and
 * presents never settle into a cadence, so a runway built from detected charges
 * alone is optimistic every month — and optimistic in the direction that hurts,
 * because warning is the whole point of the number.
 *
 * The gap is measured from the user's own history rather than from their
 * budgets: budgets are optional, cover a handful of categories, and state an
 * intention rather than a prediction. The recurring pivot makes the split exact
 * — a transaction either belongs to a series the forecast walks or it does not
 * — so nothing has to be inferred about which spending the projection covers.
 * Belonging to a series is not enough on its own: see notAlreadyRecurring().
